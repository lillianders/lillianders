Create me a professional looking cv website. It should be a single html file called webpage.html, use tailwind from cdn.

Create a personal CV/portfolio website for Lilli Anders, biomedical engineer, using the exact color palette and icon style from her CV PDF. The design should be clean, modern, minimalistic, with rounded corners, soft shadows, and generous white space. Layout is one-page scroll with navigation: About | Experience | Research | Skills.

1. Header / Navigation
   Fixed top header: “Lilli Anders” (CV heading color) on the left.

Navigation menu on the right: About | Experience | Research | Skills.

Hover effect: underline in CV accent color.

Background: white with muted accent line.

Include a “Download CV” button and link it to the new_CV_4-8-2025.pdf.

2. About Section (Hero)
   Background: White with subtle CV-style geometric patterns.

Center everything

Rounded profile photo with soft white border. next to it: Name: Lilli Anders (large bold, CV heading color)

Subtitle: Biomedical Engineer (accent color)

underneath Key details with CV-style icons:
